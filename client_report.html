        <h1>Client Report</h1>

        <h3>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h3>
        <p>My original idea was to make a website to guess individual Pokémon each day, kind of like Wordle. However, I ran into more issues than I expected, but I did get the basis of the website in.</p>

        <h3>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h3>
        <p>Thankfully no, my lead dev and I communicated well. The only hiccups were when he left his computer at home and was unable to work for a bit.</p>

        <h3>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h3>
        <p>Yes, he did a great job and met all my expectations.</p>

        <h3>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h3>
        <p>I'll make sure that my junior devs actually do the work they were assigned instead of going silent.</p>

<h1>Lead developer Report</h1>
<h3>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h3>
<p>My Junior devs did not work, the project owner and I reached out to them many times, even in class, but they didn't end up actually contributing to the project.</p>

<h3>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h3>
<p>Thankfully no, my client and I communicated well.</p>

<h3>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h3>
<p>I would say i handled it well, and the client is pleased with how their website turned out in the end of things even with the junior devs not helping.</p>

<h3>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h3>
<p>It was a great experience, i had no issues with GitHub. I'm excited to use it more in the future.</p>

<h1>Junior Developer Report</h1>
<h3>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h3>
<p>There were a few hiccups that I faced in both projects, however that was due to others making assumtions as well as taking and editing my work and claiming it as their own.</p>

<h3>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h3>
<p>After looking over the site plan, yes i knew what the client was asking me to do.</p>

<h3>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h3>
<p>Yes, even with the issues and problems that I encountered.</p>

<h3>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h3>
<p>Thankfully no, I didn't have any issues.</p>

    <h1>General experiences and reflections</h1>
    <h3>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h3>
    <p>The most challenging part for me was the communication and collaboration with my team members. Despite some issues, I was able to overcome them by actively seeking out solutions and maintaining open lines of communication.</p>

    <h3>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h3>
    <p>For me, being able to stretch and use the skills i have learned and are still learning.</p>

    <h3>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h3>
    <p>For me, i would make sure that my junior devs actually do the work they were assigned instead of going silent. Either that, or just doing all the work myself instead.</p>

    <h3>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h3>
    <p>Yes, I feel more confident. This project has given me a better understanding of how to work in a team and manage projects, which are valuable skills for real-world scenarios. However there are some cases where I don't know if i want to work in larger teams, maybe small teams however.</p>
